=============


TODO:
  * Add checkbox and shit to the "Scalpel On" to make it look like more of a switch
  * Menu option to screenshot the page
  * ENTER should be the same as clicking the 'check' in dialog
  * Adding an item should expand the day section
  * Custom ListView that shows an indicator if there's more content to be scrolled
    * And a custom scrollview though this one would have to just be a shadow or something - not enough space like a listview to go crazy with an indicator
  * Need to add an INBOX |__| icon to action bar for non-scheduled
  * Use DayItem to change the list view adapter to type <DayItem> instead of <String> then fix the dialog logic
  * Correct the sections: MORNING, AFTERNOON, EVENING, NIGHT
  * Time Buttons
    * Need a selected state (and a default selected one)
    * Need an inbox for ones that don't have a time


Problems:
  * Expanded/collapsed state is confusing (not apparent, no indicators)
  * How to deal with multi-line as day item text?

Animations:
  * animate collapsing/expanding
