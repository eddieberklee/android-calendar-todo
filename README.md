=============


TODO Inbox:
  * Custom ListView that shows an indicator if there's more content to be scrolled
    * And a custom scrollview though this one would have to just be a shadow or something - not enough space like a listview to go crazy with an indicator
  * Need to add an INBOX |__| icon to action bar for non-scheduled


  * Correct the sections: MORNING, AFTERNOON, EVENING, NIGHT
    (but before this - change ListView to ScrollView)


__Quick Wins__
  * Hiding nothing shouldn't show that border for the summary text
  * Add checkbox and shit to the "Scalpel On" to make it look like more of a switch

__Keyboard Problems__
  * Enter doesn't work on an actual device - only on computer keyboard

__Swipe Bugs__

__Time Buttons__
  * Need a selected state (and a default selected one)
  * Need an inbox for ones that don't have a time

__Animations__

__Theoretical Problems__
  * Expanded/collapsed state is confusing (not apparent, no indicators)
  * How to deal with multi-line as day item text?
